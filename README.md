## üì¶ Overview of Core Modules

### 1. **Product Management**
The product module allows clients to retrieve product listings, view product details, filter by brand or type, search by name, sort by price, and handle pagination.

- **Listing**: Retrieve a list of available products.
- **Details**: Fetch individual product details using a unique identifier.
- **Sorting**: Products can be sorted in ascending or descending order by price.
- **Filtering**: Products can be filtered by brand or type.
- **Search**: Clients can search products by name.
- **Pagination**: Supports paginated responses for large product catalogs.
- **CRUD**: Create, update, or delete product entries.

### 2. **Product Categories**
Two main categorizations are used:

- **Brands**: Represents the brand or manufacturer of the product.
- **Types**: Represents the category or type of the product (e.g., electronics, clothing, etc.).

Clients can fetch the full list of available brands and types to populate dropdowns or filters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes

- **Authentication**: Some endpoints require token-based authentication. Always include the `Authorization` header when accessing protected routes.
- **Pagination**: When working with product lists, use pagination parameters to avoid loading large datasets all at once.
- **Error Handling**: The API uses standard HTTP response codes and often includes helpful error messages in the response body.

## üöß Recommendations

- Update HTTP methods (e.g., avoid using GET for actions like adding orders or products).
- Use HTTPS in production for secure data transmission.
- Validate inputs on both client and server side.
- Use consistent naming conventions for endpoints and query parameters.
